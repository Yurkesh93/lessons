						<h2>What is Healthy Eating?</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="eating__text">
						<p>
							Food helps us to fuel our bodies, giving us the energy that we need to keep active as well as
							supporting our bodies to grow and develop. We need to provide our body with proper nutrients in
							order to survive, and we get proper nutrition through healthy eating.

							Examples of the ways that different nutrients are used in our body include using minerals to make
							hormones, build bones and regulate our hormones.

						<p>
							Lots of people know that fruits and vegetables are important for healthy eating, but to get proper
							nutrition, we need to eat a balanced diet. A balanced diet is made up of lots of different foods, a
							variety of food is needed in the diet because different foods contain different substances that are
							needed to keep our bodies healthy. We should think about how we are balancing the food that we are
							eating at every meal, an average meal should be made up of one-third of carbohydrates and one-third
							of fruit and vegetables, with the remaining one-third split between dairy, protein and a little bit
							of fat.

						<h3>The Importance of Different Food Groups</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="food-groups__text">
						<p>
							The reason that a balanced diet is so important is that each food group can provide us with
							different nutrients. The food groups are fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates, protein and dairy.
						</p>
						<p>Fruits and vegetables are some of the healthiest foods that we can eat, and they are great sources
							of vitamins and minerals, including vitamin C and potassium, as well as dietary fibre, which helps
							us to maintain healthy digestion. High amounts of fibre in your diet can help you to reduce the
							risk of heart diseases, strokes and some forms of cancer.
						</p>
						<p>Foods that are carbohydrates include bread, rice, potatoes, pasta and other starchy foods. They are
							great sources of long-term energy, which is important for keeping us active and focused throughout
							the day. These foods also contain fibre, calcium, iron and B vitamins, which is why it is important
							to eat them every day.

			<p>
				In the UK, all food has to be labelled designed to help you understand the levels of fats, salt and added
				sugars in the food that you are picking up. These labels are colour coded red, amber and green like a
				traffic light system. With green being low, amber being medium and red being high, picking up food with
				green labels tends to be a healthier choice.
